* Tiny Icons at the bottm http://www.flaticon.com/search?word=guitar - BEING WORKED ON
* standard roles for the songs - DONE can be modified - NEXT UP
* genius api for lyrics and validation
* bringing own instrument? instrument supplied?
* make separate table for Instruments

### LEOS STUFF

* songsterr.com for leo



Things we probably won't do
* Artist Image from whatever api just to make it show up and song image - this goes at the end NOT A PRIORITY
* spotify playlist with the all the songs it he catalog - SAME QUITE A STUPID IDEA, WHO THOUGHT OF THIS???
